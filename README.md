- 👋 Hi, I’m @dominiquemattos
- 👀 I’m interested in web design, data science, and DS/programming applied to social sciences/political science.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python (not so easy, huh?)
- 💞️ I’m still exploring, still trying to understand how this community works (I'm 10000% beginner at this, I swear!)
- 📫 How to reach me: DM me on my Twitter, or send me a classic email through dominique.mattos.ismart@gmail.com
